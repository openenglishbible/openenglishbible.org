  <h1>How other people have used the Open English Bible</h1>
  <p>The OEB has from the start been intended to be more than just another translation. We anticipate it being the base for many translations. The text of the OEB is as free from restriction as we can make it, so that anyone can take it and use it as their own beliefs and conscience dictate — without requiring our permission or approval.</p>
  <p>The OEB is yours to remix, republish and rethink. This page shows a small sample of the ways in which people like you have used the OEB text.</p>

      <h2 class="subheader">A New New Testament</h2>
	  <p>By Hal Taussig</p>

      <p>When Hal Taussig, a pastor and early Christianity scholar, was looking for a translation of the New Testament he could put togther with new translations of several non-canonical writings from the early Christian communities, he and his team chose the OEB. </p>

	  <p>The flexibility and openness of the OEB allowed his team to rework it to fit in with their other transations - providing a uniform translation approach across both scripture and the other ancient writings.</p>

	  <p>The author hopes this will give fresh insights where repetition and familiarity may have dulled us.</p>

    <h2 class="subheader">The New Jefferson Bible<br><small>The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth in Modern English</small></h2>
	<p>By Dan Marshall</p>
      <p>Thomas Jefferson's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Bible">The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth</a>" is his famous attempt to reconcile the Bible with his enlightenment, deistic ideals. Literally cut and pasted from the King James Version, Jefferson's aims can nowdays be muddied by the beautiful but opaque language of the translation he worked from.</p>
	  <p>Using the text of the OEB, Dan Marshall has recreated the Jefferson Bible in modern English, together with extensive notes and comments of his own.</p>
	  <p>On his <a href="http://www.newjeffersonbible.com/2013/07/the-new-jefferson-bible.html">blog</a>, Dan says "making The New Jefferson Bible would have been impossible were it not for the Open English Bible translation. The terms of this translation are so open it might as well be public domain. I owe them a debt of gratitude for making this work possible. Had it not been for them, I would have had to choose between translations old enough to be public domain, many of which do not read well, or risking legal trouble by using a translation without permission. I am glad I did not have to make that choice."
