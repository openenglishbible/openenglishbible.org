Weâ€™re pleased to announce a new release of the OEB, including the New Testament and Psalms and available from the front page of the Open English Bible website at http://openenglishbible.org

Some of the improvements include:

* Continual improvements on the backend build software.
* Addition of the book of Hosea.
* Various adjustments to improve naturalism of language and minor transcription errors.

We hope you like this release. We are now working on the remaining book from the Minor Prophets - Amos - and will do a new release when that work is completed.
