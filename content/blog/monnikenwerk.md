Christiaan, an artist from the Netherlands, has written to let us know his use of the Gospels from the Open English Bible in his [evangeliary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangeliary) according to the ‘Carolingian’ style of western medieval bookbinding (c. 800-1100).

His blog at his site Monnikenwerk has a great description of the [binding process](https://monnikenwerk.art/tutorials/making-of-plain-carolingian-bible/) with pictures.

Christiaan explains that the bindings are natural-colored deer leather on wooden boards (historically oak), as would have been used in monasteries of that period.

The text is laid out in a Carolingian Minuscule font called [Pfeffer Mediaeval](https://robert-pfeffer.net/schriftarten/englisch/) which was created by Dr. Pferrer. This is the ancestor of our modern [Antiqua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiqua_(typeface_class)).

I&nbsp;am&nbsp;always amazed and humbled by the beautiful things people have made with the Open English Bible.
