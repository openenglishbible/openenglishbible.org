# Development

This is the development page for the Open English Bible. If you would like to help out, the steps are first to join the forum, then secondly to help check one of the books not yet in release.

## GitHub

Discussion about the development, and the OEB project in general, happens on <a href="https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/discussions">the discussion forum on GitHub</a>. You can post on the forum with your GitHub account.  

An older forum is now archived at <a href="https://forum.openenglishbible.org">forum.openenglishbible.org</a>.

All of the raw sources for the OEB are developed as USFM files on the <a href="http://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible">git repository at GitHub</a>. Unless you are familiar with USFM and Git, you may want to look at the MS Word documents linked below.

## All Books

These links are for the current build of those books in the general release. This is based on the GitHub repository.

<style>
.header { color: #ffffff; background-color: #8fadcc; }
.name { font-size:1.0em; }
.comment { color:darkgray; font-size:0.9em; }
.absent { color:lightgray; }
.partial { color:darkgray; }
.unchecked { color:orange; }
.checked { color:black; }
.released { color:green; }
</style>

<p>Each book being worked on is here, with links to rtf files and to the original marked up USFM on Github.</p>
  
<p>Books are marked as being <span class="absent">absent</span>, <span class="partial">partial</span>, <span class="unchecked">unchecked</span>, <span class="checked">checked</span>, <span class="released">released</span>. Unless the book has been released (and is in the main build) please treat it with caution as it probably contains errors. In particular, books marked <span class="partial">partial</span> or <span class="unchecked">unchecked</span> could contain almost anything, including missing verses, egregious translation errors and disparaging references to penguins.</p>
